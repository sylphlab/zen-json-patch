# Active Context: zen-json-patch

## Current Focus
- Prepare for implementing array diffing logic.
- Commit current progress.

## Recent Changes
- Created `src/types.ts` with JSON Patch operation interfaces.
- Created `src/path.ts` with JSON Pointer helper functions.
- Implemented basic recursive structure in `src/index.ts` (`diff`, `compareValues`, `compareObjects`).
- Added naive placeholder for `compareArrays`.
- Installed dev dependencies: `typescript`, `@types/node`.
- Fixed TS errors related to `console` and function order.


## Next Steps
- Commit current code structure.
- Research and select an efficient array diffing algorithm (e.g., LCS/Myers diff).
- Implement the chosen array diffing algorithm in `compareArrays`.
- Add basic unit tests for existing functionality (object diffing, path helpers).

## Active Decisions
- Project name: `zen-json-patch`
- Language: TypeScript
- Core goal: Extreme performance for JSON Patch generation.

## Blockers
- None currently.
