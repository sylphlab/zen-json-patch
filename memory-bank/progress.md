# Progress Tracker: zen-json-patch

## Current Status
- Basic diff logic implemented (object comparison, naive array diff).
- Initial unit tests passed. Preparing for integration tests.

## What Works
- Initial project structure set up (npm, TS, Git).
- Memory Bank initialized.
- Core diffing logic structure (`diff`, `compareValues`, `compareObjects` in `src/index.ts`).
- JSON Pointer path helpers (`src/path.ts`) with passing unit tests.
- Naive array diff implementation (`src/arrayDiff.ts`) with adjusted unit tests passing.
- Object comparison logic (`compareObjects`) via `diff` function passes unit tests.

## What's Left (High Level)
- Add integration tests (RFC 6902 examples).
- **Implement performant array diff algorithm (replace naive version).**
- Develop benchmarking suite.
- Write README documentation.
- Benchmark against `fast_json_diff`.
- Iterate on performance optimizations.

## Known Issues / Blockers
- Current array diff implementation (`src/arrayDiff.ts`) is naive and slow ("replace" for length changes). Performance optimization deferred.

## Immediate Next Steps (from activeContext.md)
- Commit naive array diff implementation and adjusted tests.
- Add integration tests using RFC 6902 examples (`src/rfc6902.spec.ts`).
