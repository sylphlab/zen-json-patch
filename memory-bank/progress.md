# Progress Tracker: zen-json-patch

## Current Status
- Initial project setup phase.
- Memory Bank structure established.

## What Works
- Memory Bank file creation in progress.

## What's Left (High Level)
- Complete initial project setup (npm, tsconfig, git).
- Implement core diffing logic (recursive descent).
- Implement object diffing.
- Implement optimized array diffing (research required).
- Implement value diffing.
- Implement JSON Pointer path generation.
- Create API endpoint (`diff` function).
- Develop comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, RFC vectors).
- Develop benchmarking suite.
- Write README documentation.
- Benchmark against `fast_json_diff`.
- Iterate on performance optimizations based on benchmarking.

## Known Issues / Blockers
- None.

## Immediate Next Steps (from activeContext.md)
- Create `memory-bank/.clinerules`.
- Initialize TypeScript project (`npm init -y`).
- Configure `tsconfig.json`.
- Create `src/` directory.
- Initialize Git repository (`git init`).
- Make initial commit.
