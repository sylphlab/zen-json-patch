# Progress Tracker: zen-json-patch

## Current Status
- Basic diff logic implemented (object comparison, naive array diff).
- Unit and integration tests passing.
- Benchmarking suite set up with `vitest bench`, comparing against `fast-json-diff`.
- Benchmark output structure improved for clarity.

## What Works
- Initial project structure set up (npm, TS, Git).
- Memory Bank initialized.
- Core diffing logic structure (`diff`, `compareValues`, `compareObjects` in `src/index.ts`).
- JSON Pointer path helpers (`src/path.ts`) with passing unit tests.
- Naive array diff implementation (`src/arrayDiff.ts`) with passing unit tests.
- Object comparison logic (`compareObjects`) via `diff` function passes unit and integration tests.
- Integration tests using RFC 6902 examples (`src/rfc6902.spec.ts`).
- Benchmarking configured and running (`bench/*`, `vitest.config.ts`).

## What's Left (High Level)
- **Implement performant array diff algorithm (replace naive version).**
- Write README documentation.
- Iterate on performance optimizations based on benchmark results (once array diff is optimized).

## Known Issues / Blockers
- Current array diff implementation (`src/arrayDiff.ts`) is naive and slow ("replace" for length changes). Performance optimization deferred.

## Immediate Next Steps (from activeContext.md)
- Run benchmarks again (`npm run bench`) to verify cleaner output and structure.
- Add basic README.md.
