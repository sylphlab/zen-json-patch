# Progress Tracker: zen-json-patch

## Current Status
- Core diffing logic implementation phase starting.

## What Works
- Initial project structure set up (npm, TS, Git).
- Memory Bank initialized.

## What's Left (High Level)
- Implement core diffing logic (recursive descent).
- Implement object diffing.
- Implement optimized array diffing (research required).
- Implement value diffing.
- Implement JSON Pointer path generation.
- Create API endpoint (`diff` function).
- Develop comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, RFC vectors).
- Develop benchmarking suite.
- Write README documentation.
- Benchmark against `fast_json_diff`.
- Iterate on performance optimizations based on benchmarking.

## Known Issues / Blockers
- None.

## Immediate Next Steps (from activeContext.md)
- Define core types (`src/types.ts`).
- Define main API function signature (`src/index.ts`).
- Implement basic recursive traversal structure.
