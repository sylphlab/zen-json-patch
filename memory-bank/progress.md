# Progress Tracker: zen-json-patch

## Current Status
- Basic diff logic implemented (object comparison).
- **Temporary naive array diff remains in `src/arrayDiff.ts`.**
- **Comprehensive test suite (`src/arrayDiff.spec.ts`, `src/rfc6902.spec.ts`) updated with IDEAL expected outputs (including `move` operations).** These tests are expected to FAIL against the naive implementation.
- Benchmarking suite set up but deferred.

## What Works
- Initial project structure set up (npm, TS, Git).
- Memory Bank initialized.
- Core diffing logic structure (`diff`, `compareValues`, `compareObjects`).
- JSON Pointer path helpers (`src/path.ts`) with passing unit tests.
- Object comparison logic (`compareObjects`).
- **Test suite definition complete, defining the target behavior.**
- Basic benchmarking configuration.
- Basic `README.md` created.

## What's Left (High Level)
- **Implement performant array diff algorithm in `src/arrayDiff.ts` to pass the defined ideal tests.** (Primary Task for next step/AI)
- Enhance README documentation.
- Run benchmarks and iterate on performance optimizations.

## Known Issues / Blockers
- **Implementation Gap:** The current naive array diff implementation in `src/arrayDiff.ts` *will not* pass the comprehensive test suite which expects optimal diffs (e.g., `move` operations). This is the main work item remaining.

## Immediate Next Steps (from activeContext.md)
- **Run Tests:** Confirm syntax and observe expected failures.
- **Handover:** The test suite is ready for the implementation phase.
